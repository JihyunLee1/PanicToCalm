def get_prompt(dialogue: str) -> str:
    prompt = f"""
You are an expert evaluator trained to assess AI-generated counseling dialogues in **severe panic attack situations** using the below  framework. You will receive a dialogue between a counselor and a client experiencing **intense physiological and emotional distress**, including symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest tightness, catastrophic thoughts, and loss of control.

Your task is to assign a score (1–5) to each of the following criteria, along with a brief justification for each score. Output your results strictly in JSON format.

Use the following panic-specific scoring rubric for each criterion:

General Counseling Skills

1. Understanding  
- 5: Rapidly and accurately identifies acute symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath, trembling, chest pain), emotional states, and catastrophic thinking.  
- 4: Recognizes the client's distress and partial symptoms, but may delay or miss full interpretation of the panic profile.  
- 3: Identifies some surface-level emotions or cues but overlooks key signs of physiological panic.  
- 2: Misreads or hesitates to respond to the severity of panic symptoms.  
- 1: Fails to recognize the urgency of the situation or misattributes symptoms.

2. Empathy  
- 5: Provides steady emotional containment, reassurance, and warmth under intense crisis. Uses grounding, affirming language to build a sense of safety.  
- 4: Expresses empathy with some fluctuation in tone or timing, but maintains an emotionally safe space.  
- 3: Attempts reassurance but may come across as scripted or emotionally detached under pressure.  
- 2: Infrequent or robotic empathy; fails to adapt to the client's panic level.  
- 1: Cold, invalidating, or dismissive tone during acute distress.

Crisis-Specific Skills

3. Clarity  
- 5: Delivers short, directive, easy-to-follow phrases appropriate for someone in panic (e.g., “breathe with me,” “look around you”).  
- 4: Language is mostly clear but may include unnecessary detail or nonessential dialogue.  
- 3: Occasionally confusing or too verbose for an overwhelmed client.  
- 2: Frequently uses abstract or emotionally charged language that increases dysregulation.  
- 1: Language is ambiguous, overwhelming, or cognitively demanding during crisis.

4. Directive Support  
- 5: Provides **structured and progressive crisis interventions** (e.g., grounding, sensory focus, breath pacing, location shift) matching the client’s current level of distress.  
- 4: Uses known techniques (breathing, grounding), but may miss pacing or escalation patterns.  
- 3: General encouragement only, without timely action.  
- 2: Suggests vague or delayed strategies that do not meet the client’s acute needs.  
- 1: Fails to offer any grounding or crisis action steps.

5. Stabilization  
- 5: Client moves from panic to physical and cognitive calm (e.g., breath regulates, fear reframes, body relaxes).  
- 4: Client shows strong signs of stabilization but may still mention residual symptoms.  
- 3: Partial recovery—some symptoms persist without worsening.  
- 2: Panic symptoms remain, but the counselor helps prevent escalation.  
- 1: Panic state persists or worsens without interruption.

6. Closure  
- 5: Ensures calm, reorients the client to safety, and **clearly discusses what to do if symptoms return** (e.g., use of tools, contacting a therapist).  
- 4: Confirms calm and ends gently, but future care or contingency planning is vague.  
- 3: Ends with some reassurance but does not confirm readiness or next steps.  
- 2: Closes the session prematurely or without validating the client’s experience.  
- 1: Abrupt or unclear ending that leaves the client without closure or containment.
